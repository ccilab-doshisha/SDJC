# Introduction
This repository contains the data, code, and models for our paper (SDJC). It is built upon Pytorch and Huggingface.
Due to ethical issues, the educational domain corpus, and downstream task QA bot data are not public now. Please pay your patience for the ethic approvement. \
(If you want to test your model on the QAbot data, feel free to contact me, we can test your model on our server.

## Overview
While our work does not focus on developing a new general Japanese sentence embedding model, we recognize the potential of our proposed SDJC to enhance current state-of-the-art models. Although recent models have achieved impressive performance, there is still room for improvement on unseen domain-specific downstream tasks. As demonstrated in our work, SDJC successfully elevates the performance of existing state-of-the-art models on domain-specific downstream tasks, showcasing its significance and generality.

## Requirements
We recommend the following dependencies.
+ Python 3.8
+ Pytorch 1.9
+ transformers 4.22.2
+ datasets 2.3.2
+ spaCy 3.3.1
+ GiNZA 5.1.2

## Japanese STS benchmark
Another problem of Japanese sentence representation learning is the difficulty of evaluating existing embedding methods due to the lack of benchmark datasets. Thus, we establish a comprehensive Japanese Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmark on which various embedding models are evaluated.

We use the SentEval toolkit to evaluate embedding models on the Japanese STS benchmark which has been combined in our published [SentEval toolkit](/SentEval/data/downstream).

### Evaluation
You can evaluate any Japanese sentence embedding models following the commands below:
```
python evaluation.py \
    --model_name_or_path <your_model_dir> \
    --pooler  <cls|cls_before_pooler|avg|avg_top2|avg_first_last> \
    --task_set <sts|transfer|full> \
    --mode test
```

### Download data
Wikipedia data and JSNLI data for contrastive learning can be downloaded from [here](/data/download_wiki.sh) and [here](/data/download_nli.sh):
```
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/MU-Kindai/datasets-for-JCSE/blob/main/wiki1m.txt
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/MU-Kindai/datasets-for-JCSE/blob/main/nli_for_simcse.csv 
```
The target domain corpus used in our paper can be downloaded from [here](/data/clinic_corpus.txt) and [here](/data/QAbot_corpus.txt).
Due to ethical issues, the educational domain corpus is not public now, but you can check the examples in our paper.

### Data generator fine-tune and generate contradictory data
You can finetune the data generator using the code referring [this one](T5_denoising_training_clinic_domain.py). 

You can generate contradictory data referring the following code from [here](/data_generation_for_unsup.ipynb).

You can download and directly use the synthetic data in target domain for contrastive learning from the following list.
